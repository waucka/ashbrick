This is a library for using Vulkan from Rust.  Structurally, it's like wgpu, except nothing uses it,
it's extremely under-tested, it's probably missing the feature you need most, it's unmaintained, and
it was written when I knew next to nothing about Vulkan.

Feel free to adopt this library if you like, but for the love of God, don't use it for anything important
if you're not willing to turn it into something that actually works reliably.
